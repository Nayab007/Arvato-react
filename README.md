This is a Component 1 project that I have been given by Fredrik from Arvato Finance. The purpose of this project in my opinion is to how can I make it better for the web reader to see the pricing information better on the page. 

what I did is instead of having the moving bar, I did is have all the information on the page where they can easily see the information about different prices on the page, instead of scrolling the price bar. 
For accessibility did have to do much. However, if I have to add accessibility guidelines I would have Alternative Text for Images, keyboard Input for people who cannot use a mouse. Transcript for Audio for people who can't hear. I would follow the guidelines that has been set by W3C for web Accessibility.

I made the data component where I save the info for the price in the data.js file then I pass the data file to App.js. by doing that we use data files in other components if we need to pass data to other components. This page is fully responsive as well.

I also ran the test on this application, which was passed by the testing library.
